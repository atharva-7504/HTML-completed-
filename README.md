📁 HTML Practice Projects

This repository contains all my daily HTML practice files as I continue improving my frontend development skills.
Each file focuses on a different HTML concept, including:
      -Headings and text formatting
      -Paragraphs and line breaks
      -Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
      -Anchor tags & linking
      -Images and styling
      -A mini Resume/Portfolio page

These small tasks help me build a strong foundation in frontend development and write clean, structured code.
I’ll keep updating this repository as I learn new concepts every day.

🚀 Technologies Used
      -HTML5
      -Basic CSS (in some files)

✨ Goal

To improve my consistency and strengthen my core frontend skills by practicing daily.
